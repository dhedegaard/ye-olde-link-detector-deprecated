# Ye olde link detector

A small discord bot for detecting when duplicte links are being posted.

## I want to use the bot, without setting up anything:

Invite the bot to your server using this URL:

<https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=754017685888565249&permissions=68608&scope=bot>

The permissions requested are required for the bot to work correctly.

## How to get it up and running.

Run `main.ts` with `deno run --allow-net --allow-env`.

You need a Discord bot token to run the bot.

Set the token in a `TOKEN` env variable.
